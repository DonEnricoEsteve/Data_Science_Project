<h1> This repository was created for the final project of the Data Science and Advanced Python course </h1>

By Don Enrico Esteve (P9550217B) and Elizabeth Vaisman (318775277) 

The project consists of two parts: pipeline replication and pipeline implementation. 

<h3> Pipeline Replication </h3>
Pipeline replication entails reproducing all the results of the selected article "Analysis of Functional Connectivity and Oscillatory Power Using DICS: From Raw MEG Data to Group-Level Statistics in Python" (van Vliet et al., 2018). The link for this article is: https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2018.00586

<h3> Pipeline Implementation </h3>
Pipeline implementation entails applying the pipeline of van Vliet et al. (2018) to our MEG food dataset, obtained from the MEG-BIU Laboratory.
