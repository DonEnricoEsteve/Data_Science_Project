<h1> Repository for the Final project of the Data Science and Advanced Python Course </h1>

By Don Enrico Esteve (P9550217B) and Elizabeth Vaisman (318775277) 

The project consists of two parts: pipeline replication and pipeline implementation.

<h3> Pipeline Replication </h3>

Pipeline replication entails reproducing all the results of the selected article "Analysis of Functional Connectivity and Oscillatory Power Using DICS: From Raw MEG Data to Group-Level Statistics in Python" (van Vliet et al., 2018). The link for this article is: https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2018.00586

The Python scripts present here are not meant to be used standalone. It depends on running all numbered (00-12) Python scripts provided by van Vliet et al. (2018) in their repository: https://github.com/AaltoImagingLanguage/conpy/tree/master/scripts

For proprietary reasons, no data has been uploaded to this section. Instead, perform "00_fetch_data.py" found in the link above.

<h3> Pipeline Implementation </h3>

Pipeline implementation entails applying the pipeline of van Vliet et al. (2018) to our MEG food dataset, obtained from the MEG-BIU Laboratory.

<h3> Submittables </h3>
Two files are available alongside the respective directories for pipeline replication and implementation: (1) "DS_Python_Paper.pdf" serves as the report for this project in IMRAD format, and (2) "DS_Python_Presentation.pptx" was used for presenting the project last 01/30/2025.

<h3> Other files </h3>
The "requirements.txt" file contains all necessary modules and packages for the pipeline replication and implementation.
